	Three different ways to style components in React are inline, linking a CSS document, and styled components.
	Inline is the most specific way which is good for quick styles that will not be overridden. CSS documents are familiar and 
	easy to link which makes it easy to throw in quick styles. Styled Components allows the developer to use similar syntax to 
	that of the pre-processors that we are used to.
